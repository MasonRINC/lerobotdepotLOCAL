## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- **Bug Reports:** If you find a broken link, outdated information, or any other errors, please [open an issue](https://github.com/yourusername/lerobotdepot/issues) with a clear description of the problem.
- **Content Corrections:** If you notice typos or unclear sections, let us know by creating an issue or suggesting a correction in your pull request.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **New Hardware Entries:**  
  If you’d like to add a new hardware project or improve an existing entry, you have two options:
  - **Direct Pull Request:** For new hardware, you can directly submit a pull request with your proposed changes.
  - **Discussion First:** Alternatively, you may open an issue to discuss your idea with the maintainers before submitting a pull request.
  
  In your submission, please include:
  - A link to the hardware/project.
  - A brief description including key features, compatibility details, pricing, and any images.
  
### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork and Branch:**  
   Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes. For example, use a branch name like `add-new-hardware-<name>`.
2. **Make Changes:**  
   - Follow the existing structure and style of the README.
   - **Image Requirements:** Make sure that any images you add are framed appropriately. Images should be at least **640×320px** in size (for best display, please use **1280×640px**). If your image does not meet these dimensions, consider resizing or cropping it for consistency.
3. **Submit a Pull Request:**  
   Open a pull request with a clear title and a detailed description of your changes. If your pull request addresses an open issue, reference it (e.g., “Closes #XX”).
4. **Review Process:**  
   A maintainer will review your contribution and may request modifications. We appreciate your patience and cooperation during this process.

## Image Guidelines

- **Minimum Size:** Images should be at least **640×320px**.
- **Best Display:** For the best display quality, please provide images at **1280×640px**.
- **Framing:** Ensure images are framed consistently with similar dimensions across entries. This helps maintain a uniform look for the repository.
- **Attribution:** Only include images that you have the rights to use. If you have modified an image from another source, please ensure it complies with the original license and include proper attribution if required.

## Style Guidelines

- **Clarity and Consistency:**  
  Ensure that all contributions are clear, concise, and match the current style and tone of the repository.
- **Formatting:**  
  Use Markdown for any text changes. Follow the structure used in the existing README (e.g., headers, tables, bullet lists).
- **Images and Links:**  
  - Use appropriately sized images as per the [Image Guidelines](#image-guidelines).  
  - Double-check that all links work and direct users to relevant, up-to-date resources.
